#Alohomora Cards!

Hello there! the Head of Administration at Hogwarts has given us the task to create new access cards, so that the school can adapt to modern times. In this repository you'll find how to create your own Alohomora card that will grant you access throughout all campus.

By clicking on the Github Pages url (https://beta.adalab.es/project-promo-r-module-2-team-4/) attached above in the description you can enter into the magic world of Hogwarts once again. 

## The Project

This is a group project created for the second module of **Adalab's Coding Bootcamp** that centers around learning Javascript. 

It was developed using: 

* HTML
* Sass
* Javascript

## Getting Started

* This project was created using **Adalab Starter Kit**, so to start working in this project you'll need to run the command 
```
npm install
```
 that will create a node_modules folder, and allow you to work with _node.js_ and _gulp_. 

* After installing, use the command 
```
npm start
``` 
to see the changes being made in real time, without the need to use Live Server or refreshing the website. 

## What can you do?

* You can create a beautiful contact card that contains: Name, Job, Profile Image, Email, Phone and both Github and LinkedIn handles. You'll be able to see how it's gonna look in real time. 

* Choose the color palette that best suits you personality.
